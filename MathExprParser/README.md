# Math Expression Parser

This is a demo for a simple mathematical expression parser that generates code for StackVM. It's also a demo for the *Listener* pattern for antlr.

The [generated HTML](./MathExpr.html) includes a text-entry that calls the `parse_string_c` function from `mathexpr.js`. The javascript file is generated by emscripten from the C++ sources. It's kept in the git tree for convenience.
