# MI-MI-ML -- A Functionl-ish Language for Education

This is mmml, a programming language inspired by ML and F#.

It was created for the Compilers discipline at Uniritter (2016 and 2017 classes) with the objective of being easy to parse in LL(*) and facilitate code generation.

The language documentation (in pt_BR) is available in org-mode and it's produced HTML ([mmml.html](./mmml.html "MMML Documentation") and[mmml.org](./mmml.org "org-mode MMML documentation")). The HTML includes a *playground* that generates code for StackVM.
