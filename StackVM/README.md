# StackVM -- A 0-register Virtual Machine

This is StackVM, a virtual stack machine inspired by JVM.

It was created for the Compilers course at Uniritter (2016 and 2017) as a code-generation target for MMML. It was also used to showcase the use of an antlr grammar and the *Listener* pattern.

The documentation (in pt_BR) is available in [org-mode](./StackVM.org "Documentation for StackVM (org-mode)") and it's [produced HTML](./StackVM.html "Documentation for StackVM (generated HTML)"). The HTML includes a *playground* that executes StackVM code. The `stackvm.js` file in the git tree was built with `emscripten` (see main repo README for more information). It's kept here for convenience -- **do not edit it**.
